## Bug Reports and Feature requests
---
If you think you've found a bug or would like to see a feature in one of the [upcoming releases](https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io/milestones), file an [issue](https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io/issues). Please make sure that your explanations are clear and coherent; do the homework of understanding the problem and searching for existing solutions before posting.

If you're in a hurry, the fastest way to have bugs fixed or features added are code contributions. Good code contributions, to be precise; if you want to contribute, read on ...

Before writing any code, please read the

* [Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

We require all contributors to sign our
[Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/macchina-io/legal/blob/master/ContributorAgreement.md)
(CLA). When submitting a pull request you will be asked to sign the CLA via
[CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io). Our CLA is based on the
[Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement V2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) are our favorite channel for code contributions and the quickest way to get your fix or feature upstreamed and released. Here's a quick guide.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [macchina.io](https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io) repo.

2. Keep your repo [synced](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with the upstream to ensure smooth progress (i.e. that your changes do not interfere or conflict with someone elses's work). Note that the [develop](https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io/tree/develop) branch is where most of the ongoing development happens. For new features or libraries, create a new branch with a descriptive camel-cased name. See the mentioned [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for details.

3. Write the code changes; make sure they compile.

4. Write the tests (if applicable, and it is in most cases); make sure they pass.

5. Test your changes (preferably at least on major platforms - Linux, Windows, Mac).

6. Send [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a descriptive and clear commit message. You'll also have to sign our CLA unless you've already done so.

At this point, it's our turn; if you've done everything well, we may just thank you and merge your request. Otherwise, we may provide some comments or suggestions to steer the contribution in the right direction.

## Contributing Mini-FAQ
---
**Q:** Is there any type of contributing license agreement (CLA) that I have to sign to contribute new features to macchina.io?

**A:** Yes, as part of submitting a pull request we require you to sign our [CLA](https://github.com/macchina-io/legal/blob/master/ContributorAgreement.md), which is based on the widely used [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement V2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).

**Q:** How can I get write access to the Git repository?

**A:** For simplicity purposes, we keep the direct write access to the main repository within a small group of core contributors. Since git forks, merges and pull requests are very easy and simple, this was not an obstacle so far. If you believe you really, really need write access to main repo, please contact the project maintainers at <macchina.io@appinf.com>.
