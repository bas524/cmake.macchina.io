	///
	/// The Timer object creates a thread that executes all scheduled tasks
	/// sequentially. Therefore, tasks should complete their work as quickly
	/// as possible, otherwise subsequent tasks may be delayed.
	///
	/// Timer is save for multithreaded use - multiple threads can schedule
	/// new tasks simultaneously.

	/// This is a simplified version of the Poco::Util::Timer class.

		/// task queue will be purged as soon as the currently
		/// running task finishes. If wait is true, waits
