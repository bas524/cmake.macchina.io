class RemotingNG_API Transport: public AttributedObject, public Poco::RefCountedObject
	/// Transport objects are responsible for setting up and maintaining a
	/// network (or other kind of) connection between Proxy objects on the
	/// client side and Listener objects on the server side, and for exchanging
	/// messages over that connection.
	///
	/// A Transport object also maintains Serializer and Deserializer objects.
	///
	/// Transport objects must support two message exchange patterns (MEP):
	///   - One-Way: a message is sent from the client to the server and the client
	///     does not expect to receive a reply from the server. With this pattern,
	///     the server has no way to provide status information back to the client,
	///     and the client has no way to know whether the call was successful.
	///   - Request-Reply: a message is sent from the client to the server and
	///     the client expects to receive a reply from the server. The reply may
	///     be a regular reply containing a return value and/or output parameters,
	///     or it may be a fault message, reporting an exception to the client.
	///
	/// Provided a Transport object is already connected, sending a one-way
	/// message is a three-step process:
	///   1. A new one-way message is started with a call to beginMessage(). This will
	///      prepare the Transport to deliver a one-way message to the server, as well
	///      as setting up a Serializer for creating the one-way message.
	///   2. The Serializer returned by beginMessage() is used to compose
	///      the actual message.
	///   3. The one-way message is delivered to the server with a
	///      call to sendMessage(). This completes the message exchange.
	///
	/// Doing a request-reply message exchange is a five-step process.
	///   1. A new request message is started with a call to beginRequest(). This will
	///      prepare the Transport to deliver a request message, as well as
	///      setting up a Serializer for creating the request message.
	///   2. The Serializer returned by beginRequest() is used to compose
	///      the actual message.
	///   3. The request is delivered to the server with a call to
	///      sendRequest(). After delivering the request, sendRequest() will 
	///      wait for a reply from the server, and set up a Deserializer
	///      for reading the reply.
	///   4. The reply message is read using the Deserializer returned
	///      by sendRequest().
	///   5. A call to endRequest() ends the message exchange.
	///
	/// Transport objects must be able to deal with incomplete message
	/// exchange sequences. For example, if an exception occurs between
	/// a call to beginRequest() and the corresponding call to sendRequest(),
	/// sendRequest() and endRequest() will not be called for this exchange.
	/// When beginRequest() or beginMessage() is called the next time, it
	/// must do the necessary cleanup to reset the Transport object to a
	/// well-defined state.
