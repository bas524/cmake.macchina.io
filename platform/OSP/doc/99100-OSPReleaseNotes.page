OSP Release Notes
Open Service Platform

!!!Release 2020.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - The OSP framework now requires a C++14 compiler.
  - OSP Web: add special permission "**" which required either valid or no credentials.
    This is mostly useful for implementing REST APIs that support optional authentication.
  - OSP Web: added CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support. CORS preflight requests and
    all CORS headers are optionally handled by the web server, configurable via
    extension point attributes.
  - OSP Auth: added support for "inline" user attributes, which are attributes directly
    stored in the auth_user table.
  - Performance improvements due to use of C++14 features such as std::string literals.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - The OSP framework now requires a C++14 compiler
    (Minimum compiler versions: Visual C++ 2015, GCC 5, Clang 3.4).


!!!Release 2019.2

!!Summary of Changes

  - OSP Web: added support for security-related HTTP headers like
    <[Strict-Transport-Security]>, <[X-XSS-Protection]> and
    <[X-Content-Type-Options]>.
  - OSP Web: added support for bearer token-based authentication
  - OSP Web: allowed authentication methods can be restricted
  - OSP Web: for session and token-based authentication, also check that the
    associated user account still exists before granting authentication
  - OSP AuthAdminService: add support for SQL Server via ODBC
  - Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService: new pure virtual method userExists()
    (has been moved to base class from Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminService)

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - The Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthService service class has gained a new pure virtual method
    userExists(), which subclasses must implement. The method was previously defined
    in Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminService and has been moved to the base class.


!!!Release 2019.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Added support for sealed bundles. Sealed bundles cannot be extended through
    extension bundles.
  - Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminService: when user is deleted, also delete permissions, roles and attributes.
  - Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminService: added usersWithPermission(), usersWithRole(), usersWithAttribute(),
    replaceRolesForUser(), replaceUserAttributes() and findUsersByAttribute() methods.
  - Poco::OSP::Auth::Data::AuthAdminServiceImpl: fixed a bug where some (implicit and read-only) transactions
    would not be committed properly, leading to stale data to be used due to repeatable-read
    transaction isolation.
  - Shell: added passwd command (allows hidden password entry)
  - Web: added Poco::OSP::Web::WebSessionStore service, which allows for implementation of
    persistent web sessions.
  - Web: when checking whether a request is authenticated, check for HTTP Basic credentials
    first before checking for an authenticated session.
  - Web: don't show exception details in 500 error page
  - BundleCreator: warn if non-empty <files> or <code> element is in bundle specification file,
    but no matching files can be found.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2018.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Support for Modules. Modules are a way to specify dependencies between bundles,
    without referring to specific bundle names. Instead, bundles can declare which
    modules they provide, and which modules they require. The OSP framework then
    resolves module dependencies during the bundle resolve step.
  - Web: Improved support for cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) protection
    when using session-based authentication.
  - Mail: A Message-ID header can now be generated for outgoing messages.
  - New Poco::OSP::ServiceListener class for dynamically reacting to the availability
    of services.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2017.2

!!Summary of Changes

  - Bundle Signing now supports SHA-2 hash algorithms.
  - Improved error reporting in BundleLoader. If a bundle another bundle depends on
    fails to start, report the name of the failing bundle, not the name of the
    depending bundle.
  - BundleCreator: allow specifying the version of the bundle in the command-line
    arguments.
  - Web: added support for session-based authentication

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2017.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Refactored AuthAdminService to enable different database backends (e.g., MongoDB) in
    addition to the existing SQL database backend.

  - Added Poco::OSP::BundleFilter class. This new class allows filtering of bundles
    loaded by a Poco::OSP::BundleRepository.
  - Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminService: added events to notify if users or roles have
    been added or removed.
  - Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminServiceImpl: remove user permissions from cache when
    account is deleted.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

!!!Release 2016.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Poco::OSP::BundleRepository: prevent a bundle from being newly installed if a bundle
    with same symbolic name already exists.
  - Poco::OSP::BundleLoader: allow setting a fixed operating system name and
    architecture at compile time via POCO_TARGET_OSNAME and POCO_TARGET_OSARCH
    macros. If set, the values provided via these macros will be used instead
    of Poco::Environment::osName() and Poco::Environment::osArchitecture().
  - Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminServiceImpl: use transactions consequently in all
    methods modifying the authentication database.
  - Poco::OSP::Auth::AuthAdminServiceImpl: new configuration setting
    "auth.ldap.localUsers". User accounts that match the regular expression specified
    with this property will never be looked up via LDAP, always via local database only.

!!Summary of Changes

  - Allow passing arguments to OSP WebFilterExtensionPoint

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2015.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - OSP Web: WebServerDispatcher now consumes left over request data (e.g.,
    if a POST request with data is sent to a handler only accepting GET. Previously,
    the next request would fail as leftover data from POST body would spill into
    next request).
  - OSP Auth: When authenticating a user via LDAP fails, the user is removed from the local
    user database, as authentication failure can also mean that the user no longer
    exists. Furthermore, LDAP attribute names are now case insensitive.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.

    (com.appinf.osp.shell.commands).
  - OSP Shell: Help command now has aliases 'h' and '?' and also supports
    "help <command>" syntax.
  - OSP Core: Code cache is automatically updated with latest shared libraries if a new
    version of a bundle is installed. This can be disabled by setting the
    "osp.autoUpdateCodeCache" configuration property to false.
  - OSP Core: When stopping bundles, the bundle's run levels are accounted for.
  - OSP Core: Ignore directories in bundle repositories that are not valid bundles
    (not having a META-INF subdirectory).
  - OSP Core: BundleLoader has a new bundleError event fired when an error occurs
    while resolving or starting a bundle.

  - The OSP web server can now be disabled through the configuration by
    specifying a port number of 0.
  - Poco::OSP::ServiceRegistry::unregisterService() now checks for a null ServiceRef.

!!!Release 2011.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Added Visual Studio project and solution files for 64-bit builds on Visual Studio
    2008 and 2010.
  - Added basic iOS support to OSP (enabled by compiling OSP with -DPOCO_OSP_STATIC).
    This allows for static registration of bundle activators. This way, parts of
    OSP can also be used on platforms that don't support dynamic loading
    of shared libraries (such as iOS).
  - Poco::OSP::Web::WebSessionManager: it is now possible to control the domain and
    path of the session cookie by including them in the appName (e.g.,
    myCookie@.mydomain.com/path).
  - Added Crypto bundle for deploying POCO Crypto library.
  - OSP Shell services command now supports --properties option to print service
    properties.
  - OSP Web Server: if a request handler factory now returns a 0 pointer instead of a
    proper request handler instance, a 404 error is reported.
  - OSP Web Server: added Poco::OSP::Web::WebServerService. Subclasses of this class
    are registered by the standard web server and secure web server bundles and can
    be used to find port numbers and server params of running web servers.
  - Web Index bundle no longer responds to arbitrary request URIs, only / and
    /index.html (fixes a potential security issue where a request for a
    non-existing path would automatically resolve to the Web Index bundle, even
    if it's not meant to be shown).
  - Web Info bundle now displays additional information and uses Poco::Net::NetworkInterface
    class instead of DNS to enumerate IP addresses (fixes exception with embedded
    systems that lack proper DNS configuration).
  - Added convenience methods getValue() and setValue() to Poco::OSP::Web::WebSession.
  - ServiceRegistry: when registering or unregistering a service, the lock on the
    registry is now released before the corresponding event is fired.
    This allows registration or deregistration of services from within the event
    handler. Previously, this would cause a deadlock.
  - Added Poco::OSP::ServiceFinder utility class template.
  - BundleCreator: added support for extension bundles.
  - OSP: added support for extension bundles.
  - The path(list) passed to BundleRepository can now include wildcard,
    as well as direct paths to bundles.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - None at this time.


!!!Release 2009.2p4

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - The Remoting bundles have been renamed from poco.remoting.* to
    com.appinf.remoting.* as poco.* is now strictly reserved for
    bundles related to the open source POCO C++ Libraries.
    If you have dependencies on Remoting bundles in your bundles,
    please change the bundle names accordingly. Also, make sure to
    remove the old poco.remoting bundles from your bundle repositories.

  - fixed OSP shared library names to match naming conventions
  - Stopping a Remoting Transport bundle (such as poco.remoting.binary or poco.remoting.soap)
    before stopping the Remoting bundle will no longer
    crash the application, due to insufficient cleanup when unloading the transport library.
