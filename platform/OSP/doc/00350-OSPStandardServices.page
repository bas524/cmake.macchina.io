!!! Extension Point Service

The Extension Point Service allows a bundle to provide "hooks" that make it possible for other 
bundles to extend its functionality. An example would be a servlet engine implemented in a bundle, 
with actual servlets implemented in their own bundles. The actual extension mechanism and how it is 
implemented is entirely defined by a bundle. The extension point service only provides a standardized 
configuration mechanism for extension points.

The Extension Point Service is registered under the service name <[osp.core.xp]> and
implemented in the Poco::OSP::ExtensionPointService class.

A bundle that wishes to register an extension point must provide a subclass of 
Poco::OSP::ExtensionPoint and register an instance of it with the Extension Point Service.
This is usually done in the bundle's implementation of Poco::OSP::BundleActivator.

A bundle implementing an extension can do so by providing a special configuration file named 
<[extensions.xml]> in its bundle's root directory. The file has the following format:

  <extensions>
      <extension point="name">
          <!-- bundle specific content -->
      </extension>
      <!-- optionally more extension elements -->
  </extensions>
----

The actual contents of the extension element are defined and interpreted by the 
Poco::OSP::ExtensionPoint subclass that a bundle defines.

The Poco::OSP::ExtensionPointService registers itself for the <[bundleStarted]> event. 
Whenever a bundle is started, the service looks for a <[extensions.xml]> file in the bundle. 
If such a file is present, the file is parsed using the DOM parser, and for every extension element the 
corresponding Poco::OSP::ExtensionPoint object is invoked.


!!! Preferences Service

The Preferences Service provides an easy way for a bundle or service to retrieve and store 
configuration information. It also gives a bundle read-only access to the global application configuration.
The Preferences Service is implemented in the Poco::OSP::PreferencesService class.

A bundle accesses and modifies its preferences via the Poco::OSP::Preferences class.
A bundle accesses the global configuration via the Poco::OSP::Configuration class.

The Preferences Service is registered under the name <[osp.core.preferences]>.


!!! Bundle Installer Service

The Bundle Installer Service provides methods to install new bundles into a running OSP-based application,
and to replace/upgrade existing bundles with new versions. The Bundle Installer Service is implemented
by the Poco::OSP::BundleInstallerService class and registered under the service name <[osp.core.installer]>.
