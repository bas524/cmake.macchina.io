This is the first release of macchina.io, released with the intent to get
early feedback from the IoT developer community.

macchina.io is still in development. The core platform code is done and
considered stable (it's based on code having seen heavy production use
for a few years already). Work leading to 1.0 release focuses on adding
additional sensor, device and cloud service interfaces, as well as improving
the existing interfaces.
