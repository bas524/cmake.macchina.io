class IoTDevices_API SerialDevice: public IoT::Devices::Device
	/// This class provides a simple interface for accessing
	/// a serial port.
	///
	/// There are two modes of operation for receiving data:
	/// polling (blocking) mode (default) and events (callback) mode.
	///
	/// In polling mode, repeatedly call poll() to detect
	/// if data is available, then call one of the read() methods
	/// to receive available data. The read() methods can also be
	/// called if no data is available, but will block until
	/// at least one character can be read.
	///
	/// In event mode the class will start a thread that polls
	/// and reads available data from the serial port, and fires
	/// the lineReceived event whenever something has been read.
	/// Since callback mode uses readLine() to receive entire lines
	/// (if possible), delimiter characters and timeout can be set
	/// via the "delimiters" (string) and "timeout" (double) properties.
	///
	/// Clients of the class can switch between polling and event
	/// mode by enabling or disabling the "events" feature:
	///
	///     setFeature("events", true);
