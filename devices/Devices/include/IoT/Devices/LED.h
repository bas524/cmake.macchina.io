	/// The base class for LEDs.
	///
	/// Each instance of the LED class represents a single physical
	/// LED. Some LED devices support different brightness levels,
	/// this is accounted for by allowing to specify a brightness
	/// level in range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 turns the LED off and
	/// 1.0 is the maximum brightness. 
	///
	/// Some implementations may also support blinking LEDs.
	/// This is exposed via the "blinkOn" and "blinkOff" properties,
	/// which take as values the time in milliseconds the LED should
	/// be on, or off, respectively. There is also a shortcut
	/// method, blink(), which allows setting both properties at once.
	///
	/// To turn on blinking, both "blinkOn" and "blinkOff" must be 
	/// set to a non-zero value. Furthermore, the brightness must
	/// be non-zero.
