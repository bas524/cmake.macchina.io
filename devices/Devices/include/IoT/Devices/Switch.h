	/// The base class for switchable things (that can
	/// be turned on and off).
	///
	/// A Switch has a current state and a target state.
	/// Depending upon the implementation, the current state
	/// and target state may be different for a short amount
	/// of time (e.g., while the device is powering on).
	///
	/// In addition to the methods defined in this interface,
	/// a Switch implementation should expose the following
	/// properties:
	///   - displayState (string, optional): The current state of the Switch,
	///     formatted as string for display purposes.

		/// Actual behavior of this event (e.g., minimum interval
		/// between fires) are implementation specific
		/// and can be configured via properties.

		/// Creates the Switch.
